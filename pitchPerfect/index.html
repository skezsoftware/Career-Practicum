      <h2>Why is a Pitch important?</h2>
      <article>
        Your pitch should be specific, short, sweet, and flexible. Think of your
        pitch like a rubber band. You will stretch and condense it as needed for
        whatever situation you find yourself in.

      <p>
        Hi, I’m John Smith. I’m a recent graduate of Fullstack Academy, one of
        the country’s leading software engineering bootcamps. Prior to becoming
        a software engineer, I made bespoke wood furniture for 10 years and I
        loved the creativity and being able to build things that people use
        every single day. I wanted to generate more business for myself so I
        decided to build a simple Wordpress website. Well, turns out, it wasn’t
        so simple because the template wasn’t doing what I wanted it to do, and
        in an effort to customize my website, I started learning how to code. In
        doing so, I found myself really enjoying the process of building my
        website more than I did building custom furniture, so I decided to go to
        bootcamp. I love the fact that I’m still able to be creative and build
        things for people, except now, my tools are code instead of wood,
        hammer, nails and paint, and I’m looking forward to exploring fullstack
        roles where I can be part of a small team with lots of mentorship, and
        help build web applications that make a positive difference in people’s
        lives.

        <h3>This is my pitch:</h3>
        <p>
          Before embarking on my journey at Fullstack Academy to become a
          software developer, I honed my interpersonal and organizational skills
          in the restaurant industry, working as a server in high-end
          establishments. This experience taught me the importance of precision,
          teamwork, and delivering quality under pressure. My Myers-Briggs
          personality test identified me as an ESTJ, and through my research, I
          discovered that careers in computer programming and coding aligned
          well with my strengths. Intrigued, I dove into learning to code and
          quickly fell in love with it. This newfound passion ignited a desire
          to pivot my career towards software development. I am now focused on
          securing a position as a software developer where I can continue to
          grow and refine my skills. Ultimately, my goal is to transition into a
          back-end software engineering role, where I can leverage my
          detail-oriented nature and problem-solving abilities to build robust
          and efficient systems. I'm excited about the path ahead and eager to
          contribute to a team that values innovation and excellence.
