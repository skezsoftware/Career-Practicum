    <!-- EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS -->
    <div class="exerciseSection">
        <h2>Exercise: Consider the following questions.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What are you power skills?</li>
            <li>When and how have you used them in past experiences?</li>
            <li>Identify specific examples of how you've used your power skills and practice speaking and writing about them.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Here's an example of how to describe a power skill within the context of experience:</h3>
        <p>My skill in leadership and influence were gained while working in the restaurant industry. It was a high pressure environment in which some days we did not have a chance to catch our breaths and barely could keep up. I suggested some ways in which we could prep to be more efficient so we werenâ€™t caught off guard by large crowds. When we adopted these new practices it made a big difference. I also stayed upbeat and positive when things got stressful and contributed to an overall feeling of positivity during those times.

    <!-- SPECIFIC EXAMPLES FROM MY OWN SKILLS -->
    <div class="skillExercises">
        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>I earned a scholarship to play division 1 baseball at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. My junior and senior year, I noticed that I had to set an example for the younger players who are going to continue playing when I leave. I am not a very vocal leader but I do know how to work hard, so that is what I did. I always worked hard and there came a point where a freshman was out too late the night before enjoying one too many beverages. He was late to practice by about an hour and a half. I pulled him aside when nobody was around and told him that cannot happen. Have your fun but you are expected to be here on time ready to rock. If that is too much to ask, then pick one or the other. As a result he was never late again and I showed him that an older guy cares about him enough to say something to him in private. </p>

    <div class="skillExercises">
        <h3>Active Learning</h3>
        <p>During Covid, I decided to use that time to learn Spanish. This has always been a goal of mine and I am proud to say that I am fluent in Spanish now. I could have just read material and got tutored a few times a week but that was not enough for me. To practice active learning and immersion, I got a job working construction where my fellow coworkers did not speak english and I was forced to speak Spanish. On top of that, I was taking online Spanish lessons where the only language spoken was Spanish, during my free time. I told my family members who speak Spanish to only talk to me in spanish. I switched my music to all Spanish as well as my Tv shows and Movies I was watching. Learning by doing and being active was what helped me become fluent in Spanish in 1 year.</p>
