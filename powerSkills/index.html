        <h3>Situation</h3>
        <h4>Describe the scenario in which the task was demonstrated.</h4>
        <p>
          Example: When I worked a the cable company customer service center, I
          got a call from a very upset customer who was over-charged on her
          monthly bill.
        </p>

        <h3>Task</h3>
        <h4>What specific role did you play in the situation?</h4>
        <p>
          Example: When I worked at the cable company customer service center, I
          got a call from a very upset customer who was over-charged on her
          monthly bill.
        </p>

        <h3>Action</h3>
        <h4>What did you do or how did you contribute to achieve the task?</h4>
        <p>
          Example: I reviewed her bill and discovered that she had accidentally
          been charged twice for a service, so I took responsibility for our
          error, and promptly removed the extra charges from her bill.
        </p>

        <h3>Result</h3>
        <h4>What was the outcome?</h4>
        <p>
          Example: She was relieved to have the issue resolved and thanked me
          for taking care of it.

      <h2>Exercise: Consider the following questions.</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>What are you power skills?</li>
        <li>When and how have you used them in past experiences?</li>
        <li>
          Identify specific examples of how you've used your power skills and
          practice speaking and writing about them.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
        Here's an example of how to describe a power skill within the context of
        experience:
      </h3>
      <p>
        My skill in leadership and influence were gained while working in the
        restaurant industry. It was a high pressure environment in which some
        days we did not have a chance to catch our breaths and barely could keep
        up. I suggested some ways in which we could prep to be more efficient so
        we weren’t caught off guard by large crowds. When we adopted these new
        practices it made a big difference. I also stayed upbeat and positive
        when things got stressful and contributed to an overall feeling of
        positivity during those times.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- SPECIFIC EXAMPLES FROM MY OWN SKILLS -->
    <div class="skillExercises">
      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        I earned a scholarship to play division 1 baseball at the University of
        Tennessee, Knoxville. My junior and senior year, I noticed that I had to
        set an example for the younger players who are going to continue playing
        when I leave. I am not a very vocal leader but I do know how to work
        hard, so that is what I did. I always worked hard and there came a point
        where a freshman was out too late the night before enjoying one too many
        beverages. He was late to practice by about an hour and a half. I pulled
        him aside when nobody was around and told him that cannot happen. Have
        your fun but you are expected to be here on time ready to rock. If that
        is too much to ask, then pick one or the other. As a result he was never
        late again and I showed him that an older guy cares about him enough to
        say something to him in private.
      </p>

    <div class="skillExercises">
      <h3>Active Learning</h3>
      <p>
        During Covid, I decided to use that time to learn Spanish. This has
        always been a goal of mine and I am proud to say that I am fluent in
        Spanish now. I could have just read material and got tutored a few times
        a week but that was not enough for me. To practice active learning and
        immersion, I got a job working construction where my fellow coworkers
        did not speak english and I was forced to speak Spanish. On top of that,
        I was taking online Spanish lessons where the only language spoken was
        Spanish, during my free time. I told my family members who speak Spanish
        to only talk to me in spanish. I switched my music to all Spanish as
        well as my Tv shows and Movies I was watching. Learning by doing and
        being active was what helped me become fluent in Spanish in 1 year.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="skillExercises">
      <h3>Complex Problem Solving</h3>
      <p>
        Working as a Server in high-end busy restaurants is a lot of stress and
        a lot of work. One night I was the only Server for a few hours along
        with one busser and one hostess. No managers and no owners. We had a
        busy night ahead of us full with reservations. We had some large tables
        of 10, 8, and 6 that were reserved for them when they came. We were not
        taking any more reservations for the night and a table for 10 came
        trying to walk in for a table. I had to make a quick decision to let
        them eat or tell them that we are not taking any more tables. It was 4
        o’clock pm and the table for 10 was coming at 5:30pm. I told them that
        they can have this table but we have to have the table back at 5 o’clock
        pm. They ended up having a great shorter dinner and were happy with the
        food along with the service.

    <div class="skillExercises">
      <h3>Persuasion</h3>
      <p>
        Working as a sales representative selling home improvement products door
        to door can be very difficult because you are dealing with a lot of
        rejection in hope to earn a large commission from your sales. I sold a
        nice couple paint for their house that needed some work. I knocked on
        their door, started doing an inspection of their house and shared with
        them what I found and what I would recommend they do. At first they were
        hesitant but I handled their objections and continued on with my sales
        pitch. I ended up showing them a lot of pictures from previous jobs to
        build credibility. I ended up having to call a manager to get them a
        better price but at the end of the day, they signed the contract and I
        sold them paint for their whole house. They ended up very happy with the
        end result and I learned a lot from that sale.

    <div class="skillExercises">
      <h3>Time/Self Management</h3>
      <p>
        Having a rental car business can be a lot of work. The hardest part has
        been time management because the cars are always getting done with trips
        or starting trips. Having to plan out your day the day before to make
        sure that you have time for the cars and you know where they are going
        and at what time. This is also everyday of the week so there is a lot of
        self management going on. A typical strategy I like to employ is making
        as little strips as possible. Trying to match up the times with the cars
        so I can hit them all in one trip instead of three different trips.
